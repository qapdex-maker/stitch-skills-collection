**Learning:** During static HTML extraction and post-processing, inlining local images and CSS url() assets reads from and queries the filesystem repeatedly. By adding scoped, execution-local caches inside `inlineImages`, we avoid redundant IO and stats queries for duplicate assets.
**Action:** Use local Map-based caches scoped to functions performing file reads or network requests to handle duplicate references efficiently.
